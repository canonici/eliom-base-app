[%%shared.start]

(** Call this function either from client or server side
    to display an error message in the page.
    The message is displayed in a special box created automatically
    in the body of the page.
    It is displayed during a short amount of time then disappears.
    The two levels correspond to different classes that you can
    personalize in CSS.

    If [~onload] is [true], the message is displayed after the next page
    is displayed (default [false]). When called on server side, this is
    always the case.
