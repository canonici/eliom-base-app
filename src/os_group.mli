(** Groups of users.
    Groups are sets of users. Groups and group members are saved in database.
    Groups are used by EBA for example to restrict access to pages or
    server functions. *)

exception No_such_group

(* -----------------------------------------------------------------

   The implementation of this module should be sufficient. Groups are
   useful for example to allow or deny access to functions or pages.

*)

(** The type of a group *)
type t

val id_of_group : t -> int64
val name_of_group : t -> string
val desc_of_group : t -> string option

(** Helper function which creates a new group and return it as
  * a record of type [t]. *)
val create : ?description:string -> string -> t Lwt.t

(** Overwrites the function [get_group] of [Os_db.User] and use
  * the [get] function of the cache module. *)
val group_of_name : string -> t Lwt.t

(* -----------------------------------------------------------------

   All the followings functions are only helpers/wrappers around db
   functions ones. They generally use the type [t] of the module
   and get rid of the part of picking each field of the record [t].

*)

(** Insert a user to a group. *)
val add_user_in_group : group:t -> userid:int64 -> unit Lwt.t

(** Remove a user from a group. *)
val remove_user_in_group : group:t -> userid:int64 -> unit Lwt.t

(** Does user belong to a group? *)
val in_group : group:t -> userid:int64 -> bool Lwt.t

(** Returns all the groups of the database. *)
val all : unit -> t list Lwt.t
